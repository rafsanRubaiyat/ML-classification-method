## Background:
We obtained a dataset containing information on academic performances, social characteristics, and demographics of students in two Portuguese high schools Again, our objective is to utilize classification methods to predict whether a student would like to go to college based on many of the other features in our dataset Data Source: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)

## Raw Data Characteristics:
1,044 observations; 33 total variables 
Binary Response: ‘higher’ “Yes”: 955 “No”: 89 

### How does the data look like?
